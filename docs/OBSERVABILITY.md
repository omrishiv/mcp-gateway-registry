Three differences from the legacy architecture:

1. **No metrics-service container.** Each service emits metrics in-process via
   the OpenTelemetry SDK, not via HTTP POSTs to a separate Python service.
2. **No SQLite store.** Long-term retention is the operator's observability
   backend's job (Prometheus TSDB, AMP, Datadog, Grafana Cloud, etc.).
3. **No API keys.** The legacy `METRICS_API_KEY_*` family is unused; operators
   can remove them from `.env`. They are removed entirely in 1.26.0.

## Configuration

Two new application-level settings introduced in 1.25.0, plus a handful of
standard OTel SDK env vars. The full cross-surface mapping (Docker Compose
env vars, Terraform tfvars, Helm values paths) lives in
[docs/unified-parameter-reference.md, Group 25](unified-parameter-reference.md#group-25--otlp--opentelemetry-export).
The summary below highlights each setting, its default, and where to find it
on each deployment surface.

### Setting 1: `METRICS_LEGACY_HTTP_POST` — transition flag

| Surface | Where to set | Default |
|---|---|---|
| Docker Compose | `METRICS_LEGACY_HTTP_POST` in `.env` | `false` |
| Terraform / ECS | Hardcoded to `"false"` in the container env block in `terraform/aws-ecs/modules/mcp-gateway/ecs-services.tf` | `"false"` |
| Helm / EKS | `app.metricsLegacyHttpPost` in `charts/registry/values.yaml`, `metrics.legacyHttpPost` in `charts/auth-server/values.yaml` and `charts/mcpgw/values.yaml` | `false` |

When `true`, services ALSO POST JSON events to the legacy `metrics-service:8890`
in addition to the native OTel emission. Used during the 1.25.0 → 1.26.0
transition window to verify dashboards before the cutover. **Removed in 1.26.0
along with the metrics-service container itself.**

### Setting 2: `OTEL_METRIC_EXPORT_INTERVAL_MS` — SDK flush interval

| Surface | Where to set | Default |
|---|---|---|
| Docker Compose | `OTEL_METRIC_EXPORT_INTERVAL_MS` in `.env` | `15000` |
| Terraform / ECS | Hardcoded to `"15000"` in the container env block in `ecs-services.tf` | `"15000"` |
| Helm / EKS | `app.otelMetricExportIntervalMs` (registry), `metrics.otelExportIntervalMs` (auth-server, mcpgw) | `"15000"` |

Lower (e.g., `5000`) for near-real-time dashboards during incident response;
raise (e.g., `30000`) for high-traffic production where reduced OTLP push
frequency matters.

### Setting 3: `OTEL_EXPORTER_PROMETHEUS_HOST` / `OTEL_EXPORTER_PROMETHEUS_PORT`

| Surface | Where to set | Default |
|---|---|---|
| Docker Compose | `OTEL_EXPORTER_PROMETHEUS_HOST` / `_PORT` in `.env` | `0.0.0.0` / `9464` |
| Terraform / ECS | Not set explicitly; SDK default `0.0.0.0:9464` is used | `0.0.0.0:9464` |
| Helm / EKS | `app.otelExporterPrometheusHost` / `app.otelExporterPrometheusPort` (registry), `metrics.exporterPrometheusHost` / `metrics.exporterPrometheusPort` (auth-server, mcpgw) | `0.0.0.0:9464` |

Bind address and port for the in-process Prometheus exporter listener. EKS
needs `0.0.0.0` because Prometheus runs in a different pod (the chart's
`NetworkPolicy` template gates access). Compose can use `127.0.0.1` to keep
the port unreachable from outside the Docker network.

### Setting 4: `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` and friends

| Surface | Where to set | Default |
|---|---|---|
| Docker Compose | `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` (and `_PROTOCOL`, `_HEADERS`) in `.env`. Default compose ships an `otel-collector` service; uncomment the line `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://otel-collector:4317` to enable push. | unset |
| Terraform / ECS | The container env block in `ecs-services.tf` sets `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4317` when `var.enable_observability=true` (so the per-task ADOT sidecar receives it). | `http://localhost:4317` when observability is on, else unset |
| Helm / EKS | Operators inject this via the chart's `extraEnv` block (or via `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` in the chart's configmap). Point at an in-cluster collector or the OTLP receiver of your chosen vendor. | unset |

When set, the OTel SDK ALSO pushes metrics + traces via OTLP in addition to
serving the Prometheus exporter on `:9464`. The docker entrypoint additionally
wraps uvicorn with `opentelemetry-instrument`, which auto-activates the
`opentelemetry-instrumentation-fastapi`, `-httpx`, `-asyncio`, `-pymongo`,
and `-logging` packages. This produces the standard HTTP semantic-convention
metrics (`http_server_duration_*`, `http_server_active_requests`) and per-route
spans without any application code change.

`OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS` is **secret-bearing** when used with backends
like Datadog (`dd-api-key=...`) or Grafana Cloud. On ECS, source it from
AWS Secrets Manager. On EKS, use a `secretKeyRef`. On Compose, put it in
`.env` (which is gitignored).

### Setting 5: `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME` — trace attribution

| Surface | Where to set | Default |
|---|---|---|
| Docker Compose | Hardcoded per service in `docker-compose.yml`: `mcp-gateway-registry`, `mcp-auth-server`, `mcp-mcpgw` | per-service |
| Terraform / ECS | Set via the auto-instrumentation distro (defaults to the container name) | container-name-based |
| Helm / EKS | Set via `extraEnv` per pod, or rely on auto-instrumentation defaults | unset (becomes `unknown_service`) |

Without this set, OTel traces are tagged `unknown_service` in your tracing
backend, making it impossible to tell which container produced which span.
Set it explicitly when adding a new service.

## Metric inventory

The full list of metrics emitted as of 1.25.0. **Names below are the Prometheus
exposition form** (after the OTel exporter appends the unit suffix).

| `registry_deployment_mode_info` (Gauge) | registry | `deployment_mode`, `registry_mode` | Current deployment mode (always 1, observed each cycle) |

### Histograms

| Metric | Source | Labels | What it measures |
|---|---|---|---|
| `auth_request_duration_milliseconds` (`_count`, `_sum`, `_bucket`) | auth-server | `success`, `method`, `server` | Auth /validate latency |
| `tool_execution_duration_milliseconds` | auth-server | same as `tool_execution_total` | Tool call latency at auth layer |
| `protocol_latency_milliseconds` | auth-server | `flow_step`, `server_name` | Time between MCP protocol stages (init → tools/list, etc.) |
| `registry_operation_duration_milliseconds` | registry middleware | same as `registry_operation_total` | Registry API operation latency |
| `tool_discovery_duration_milliseconds` | registry middleware | same as `tool_discovery_total` | Semantic search latency |
| `peer_sync_duration_seconds` | registry | `peer_id`, `success` | Peer sync operation duration |
| `mcpgw_tool_duration_milliseconds` | mcpgw | `tool`, `success` | Per-tool invocation latency |

### HTTP auto-instrumentation (when OTel auto-instrument is active)

| Metric | Source | Labels | What it measures |
|---|---|---|---|
| `http_server_duration_milliseconds` | every service | `http_method`, `http_target`, `http_status_code`, `http_scheme`, `http_host`, `http_server_name`, `net_host_port`, `http_flavor` | Per-route HTTP request latency |
| `http_server_active_requests` | every service | same | In-flight requests right now |

> Note on `http_target`: this is the **raw URL path** (e.g.
> `/api/servers/airegistry-tools/rating`), not the FastAPI route template
> (`/api/servers/{path:path}/rating`). For paths with high-cardinality IDs
> this can produce many time series; in production with large catalogs you
> may want to add a label-relabel rule in Prometheus to collapse them.

## Query cookbook

Open `http://localhost:9090/graph` (Compose) or your AMP/Grafana UI and try
these. Most are useful in **Graph view** with the time window dropped to 5
minutes.

## Verifying the migration is working

Three checks operators can run after upgrading from 1.24.x to 1.25.0:

**1. All Prometheus targets UP**

```
http://localhost:9090/targets
```

You should see `mcp-registry`, `mcp-auth-server`, `mcp-mcpgw`, and (until
1.26.0) `mcp-metrics-service` in the targets list, all with state `UP`.

**2. Migration self-observability**

```
metrics_emission_path_total
```

Should show `path="otel"` rows incrementing on every request.
`path="legacy"` should be empty (or zero) when `METRICS_LEGACY_HTTP_POST=false`.
If both are incrementing, you have the dual-write transition flag enabled.

**3. Previously-invisible counters are now visible**

```
nginx_config_writes_total
peer_sync_failures_total
m2m_orphan_cleanups_total
```

These were `prometheus_client.Counter` instances declared in the registry
process for releases but never exposed anywhere. If they return rows now,
the migration to OTel-native emission worked.

## Troubleshooting

### A Prometheus target shows DOWN with "connection refused"

The OTel SDK Prometheus exporter starts during application startup, after
the SDK initializes. Containers go `Up` before this completes. Wait one or
two scrape intervals (10-20 seconds) and re-check. If still DOWN:

```bash
docker compose exec <service> ss -tlnp | grep 9464
```

If that shows nothing, the Prometheus exporter never bound. Most common
cause: `OTEL_EXPORTER_PROMETHEUS_HOST` is unset, so the bootstrap helper
in the meter module took the no-op path. Set it in `.env` and recreate the
container.

### A query returns "Empty query result"

In order:

1. Wait one minute. Counters appear after first emission. Histograms appear
   after first observation. Rate functions need at least 2 data points in
   the rate window.
2. Try the simpler form: drop labels and aggregations, just type the metric
   name. If that returns rows, your filter is wrong (most often: a label
   typo).
3. Check the raw exposition: `docker compose exec prometheus wget -qO- http://<service>:9464/metrics 2>/dev/null | grep <metric>`.
   If the metric is there, Prometheus's scrape didn't pick it up yet
   (10-second scrape interval). If it's not there, the application code
   didn't emit it.

### `*_milliseconds_*` metric names look weird

That's standard. The OTel-to-Prometheus exporter appends the OTel `unit=`
annotation to histogram metric names. So a Histogram declared with
`unit="ms"` exports as `<name>_milliseconds`, regardless of what we named
the OTel instrument. The naming follows the OTel spec.

### I want to inspect what's actually being scraped without going through Prometheus

```bash
docker compose exec <service> curl -s http://localhost:9464/metrics
```

Or from any other container on the Docker network:

```bash
docker compose exec prometheus wget -qO- http://<service>:9464/metrics
```

### I want metrics flowing to AMP / Datadog / Honeycomb instead of (or in addition to) Prometheus

Set `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` and `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS` in `.env`.
The OTel SDK will then push every metric over OTLP in addition to serving
the Prometheus exporter on `:9464`. On ECS, the AMP push is wired
automatically via the per-task ADOT sidecar (Phase E of #1122).

### How do I disable OTel emission entirely

Don't set `OTEL_EXPORTER_PROMETHEUS_HOST`, don't set `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`.
The bootstrap helpers will detect the unset state and leave the SDK in
NoOp mode. Every `Counter.add()` and `Histogram.record()` call across the
codebase becomes a zero-cost no-op.

## Adding a graphical trace UI

The default `docker-compose.yml` ships an `otel-collector` container that
receives traces from registry/auth-server/mcpgw and logs them to stdout
via the debug exporter (good for verification, awkward for browsing). If
you want a visual trace browser locally, drop in a Jaeger or Tempo
container and route the collector's traces pipeline to it. The eight
lines below give you Jaeger at `http://localhost:16686/`.

**Step 1**: add a `jaeger` service to your `docker-compose.yml`
(e.g., before the `prometheus` service):

```yaml
  jaeger:
    image: jaegertracing/all-in-one:latest
    environment:
      - COLLECTOR_OTLP_ENABLED=true
    ports:
      - "16686:16686" # Jaeger UI
    restart: unless-stopped
```

**Step 2**: in `config/otel/collector.yaml`, add a Jaeger exporter and
include it in the traces pipeline:

```yaml
exporters:
  # ... existing exporters ...
  otlp/jaeger:
    endpoint: jaeger:4317
    tls:
      insecure: true

service:
  pipelines:
    traces:
      receivers: [otlp]
      exporters: [debug, otlp/jaeger]   # add otlp/jaeger here
```

**Step 3**: bring it up:

```
docker compose up -d jaeger
docker compose restart otel-collector
```

Open `http://localhost:16686/`, pick a service from the dropdown
(`mcp-gateway-registry`, `mcp-auth-server`, `mcp-mcpgw`), click
**Find Traces**. Each trace shows the full waterfall: HTTP span at the
top, child spans for downstream calls (MongoDB queries, httpx requests
to the registry, FastMCP tool dispatch, etc.).

The same pattern works with Tempo, Zipkin, or any OTLP-receiving
backend — swap the exporter type. We don't ship Jaeger by default to
keep the Compose footprint minimal and to avoid pulling an extra image
in restricted environments.
