"""Shared gateway-proxy opt-in for registry entities + the SSRF egress guard.

Any entity type (MCP server, A2A agent, skill, virtual server, custom entity)
can opt into being served through the gateway by setting ``is_proxied=True``.
The registry then generates an nginx location block that routes authenticated
traffic to the entity's effective backend URL.

Security posture (this module is the application-layer SSRF control):
- ``_assert_egress_allowed`` rejects loopback / private / reserved / multicast
  targets unless ``gateway_proxy_allow_private_targets`` is set, and ALWAYS
  rejects link-local (which includes the cloud metadata endpoint) and the
  unspecified address regardless of that flag.
- The guard is a best-effort STATIC check on literal-IP targets. Hostnames pass
  here (DNS is resolved downstream by nginx/httpx); the authoritative defense
  against DNS-rebind is the network egress policy (deny metadata/link-local at
  the socket layer) documented in the LLD, not this function.
- The same guard is DESIGNED to run at three points (model validator, repository
  persist, nginx render) so a row written before the policy existed, or by a
  federation sync that bypasses the Pydantic validator, still cannot emit a live
  route to a denied host. This module lands the model validator; the persist-path
  and render-path hooks are added in the federation-enforcement and nginx-render
  changes respectively. The feature ships disabled (gateway_generic_proxy_enabled
  defaults false) until all three are in place.

Note vs. registry/services/ard_net_guard.py: that guard resolves DNS and checks
every resolved IP, defeating rebind at check time. This guard deliberately does
NOT resolve (proxy targets are long-lived and re-validated by a refresh + the
network egress policy), so a hostname target is only network-layer-protected.
It is therefore a WEAKER static check than ard_net_guard by design; do not enable
the feature until the network egress policy (SSRF layer 1) is deployed.
