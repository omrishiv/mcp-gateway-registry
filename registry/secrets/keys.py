"""Deterministic, collision-free vault-key canonicalization.

The vault key is ``(auth_method, user_id, provider, server_path)``.
The raw values are NOT safe to use verbatim as path/map segments:

- ``user_id`` varies by IdP. Cognito/Okta ``sub`` are UUID/alphanumeric (safe),
  but Keycloak ``preferred_username`` can contain spaces/accents, Entra UPNs
  contain ``@``/``+``, and **Auth0 ``sub`` is ``auth0|abc`` -- the ``|`` would
  collide with the Secrets Manager map delimiter and break OpenBao paths.**
- ``server_path`` contains ``/`` -- the OpenBao KV path separator.

The fix is ONE canonical encoding applied uniformly in every backend:
**Unicode-NFC-normalize, then base64url-encode (unpadded)** each segment so no
segment can contain a separator (``/`` or ``|``) or a Unicode look-alike. NFC
first prevents NFC-vs-NFD silent collisions on non-ASCII usernames.

base64url (RFC 4648 §5, unpadded) is used deliberately instead of
percent-encoding: its alphabet is ``[A-Za-z0-9_-]`` only, so an encoded segment
contains **no** ``/``, ``|``, ``%``, or ``=``. Percent-encoding is unsafe here
because the OpenBao HTTP client (hvac) re-quotes the path it is given, turning a
percent-encoded ``/`` (``%2F``) into ``%252F`` on the wire -- a path OpenBao
will not match (encoded slashes defeat its ACL/path routing), which broke every
vault read. base64url has no such reserved characters, so it survives hvac
re-quoting and OpenBao path routing unchanged.

All three SecretStore backends MUST build keys through these helpers so they
agree byte-for-byte (asserted by the cross-store round-trip test).
