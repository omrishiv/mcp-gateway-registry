"""OpenBaoStore -- per-entry KV v2 SecretStore for per-user egress tokens.

Each connection is its own KV v2 entry at::

    {mount}/data/{prefix}/{enc(auth_method)}/{enc(user_id)}/{enc(provider)}/{enc(server_path)}

so there is no shared blob and no read-modify-write race between two providers
of the same principal. ``list_for_user`` walks the KV LIST under the principal
prefix. Same-key writes (a refresh and a consent for the same connection) are
last-writer-wins at the store level; the cross-replica single-flight refresh
lease lives in the egress service above this store. Read-repair migration uses
KV v2 check-and-set (``cas``) plus a value comparison, so re-encrypting a legacy
entry never clobbers a concurrent refresh (the conditional write is rejected if
the entry changed since the re-read).

Uses ``hvac`` (Vault/OpenBao API-compatible). Auth is configured by the
factory (token / kubernetes / approle) before the client reaches this class.
